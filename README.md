# Studies about Interactive Quantum Classifier Inspired by Quantum Open System Theory
The root folder contains Python notebooks related to an algebric study about Zhang et. al's [Interactive Quantum Classifier Inspired by Quantum Open System Theory](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9533917) (later referred as ICQ) model. This repository also include a scikit classifier based estimator using the ICQ calculations, and another estimator with the proposed change to the model - available under the [classifiers folder](classifiers/).

The evaluation of both original ICQ model and the changed one is available under [experiments folders](experiments/), on each dataset.

The algorithmical study of the ICQ model is available under [studies folder](studies/).

- This repository contains code used to study and replicate the experiments described by Zhang et. al in [Interactive Quantum Classifier Inspired by Quantum Open System Theory](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9533917) and contains suggested changes proposed by Eduardo Barreto Brito (ebb2@cin.ufpe.br) and Fernando Maciano de Paula Neto (fernando@cin.ufpe.br), together with Rodrigo Abreu Alves de Freitas Mota (raafm@cin.ufpe.br), Stefan Michael Blawid (sblawid@cin.ufpe.br) and Nadja Kolb Bernardes (nadjakb@gmail.com).
- It is written by Fernando Maciano de Paula Neto (fernando@cin.ufpe.br), Eduardo Barreto Brito (ebb2@cin.ufpe.br) and revised by Nadja Kolb Bernardes (nadjakb@gmail.com).
- Its results are used to produce the paper titled _Quantum classifier based on open quantum systems with amplitude information loading_, available [in this link][https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-3944517/v1], and for the Masters dissertation of Eduardo Barreto Brito, titled _Analysis and proposal of a quantum classifier based on open quantum systems with amplitude information loading_.
